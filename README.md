### 🐔 Poultry Disease Classification using Transfer Learning

This project aims to build a web-based system to detect common poultry diseases from images using deep learning. The system uses a pre-trained CNN model (VGG16) and a Flask-based frontend that allows farmers to upload images and receive a prediction about the bird’s health.

#### ✅ Key Features:
- Classifies poultry diseases into 4 categories:
  - Coccidiosis
  - Salmonella
  - NewCastle
  - Healthy
- Trained using transfer learning (VGG16)
- Web interface for image upload and prediction
- Responsive and lightweight design

#### 🧠 Technologies Used:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Flask
- HTML / CSS
- Python
